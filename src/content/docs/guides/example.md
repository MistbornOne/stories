title: Navigating The Stories
description: A guide to reading stories on my site.

## Site Layout

The way this site is laid out is fairly straightforward, but I still want to give a quick guide on navigating it, just in case.

### Left Panel

On the left hand side you'll see a sidebar with several choices (hopefully this grows over time). Think of these as individual books. Nested under each of this will be chapters, as you'd expect.

The exception to the rule is the **Short** **Stories** section, which doesn't have chapters, but individual short stories listed beneath it.

### Middle Panel

The middle of the page is where the content of the chapter or story will be displayed, as it is here.

### Right Panel

The right panel is where the outline of the current chapter or short story will be displayed. If there are headings or sections within the chapter, you will be able to navigate those quickly by clicking on the links in this panel.

## Navigating Stories

When you choose a book you wish to read, choose the first chapter listed under the heading. You can then read the chapter in the middle panel. When you reach the end of the chapter, you will have two buttons for navigating to the previous and next chapter on the bottom.

You can thus easily jump to the next chapter without needing to worry about the left panel. However, if you want to, you can use that navigation pane as well.

# Thank You üôèüèº

I want to acknowledge that you could be doing many other things with your time and I am thankful that you've chose to use a portion of it to read my stories. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

Without further ado... **Happy Reading üìö**
