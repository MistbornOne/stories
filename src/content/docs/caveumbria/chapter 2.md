Leviathan walked out of his apartment building and into the dimly lit alley. Goyletown was one of the many ethnic districts within the vast city of Caveumbria and sat high up on a hill on the eastern edge of town. The buildings here were mostly made from brick or cinder block and were several stories high. Tiny alleys wound their way through the high rises like the paths of an anthill.

He exited the alley onto the main street that ran through his part of town. It was wide enough for two healthy lanes, but was made of traditional paver stones, rather than the poured asphalt most of the city contained. Gargoyles were _particular_ about certain traditions and this was one of them.

He jogged across the empty street and onto the sidewalk, starting the lengthy walk down the hill from Goyletown to the Mole District. Everybody knew if you wanted to obtain something _not strictly legal_, the best place to go in Caveumbria was the Mole District. He had found out long ago that it also happened to be a great starting point for finding information about crime. Turns out a lot of miscreants like to brag about their accomplishments.

His leathery feet thudded quietly on the sidewalk, creating a pleasant rhythm with the sounds of the city below. He looked out over the city and smiled, shaking his head. He often took it for granted that he lived in a sprawling metropolis underground, but every now and again it would catch his attention and his breath along with it.

He had never been anywhere other than Caveumbria. No one had for nearly four generations. His grandmother had been born topside and told him many stories about how wonderful it was before the war. When she was feeling particularly nostalgic, she’d stare off into space and talk about the sky being blue and the day time being so bright you didn’t even need lamps! Who could imagine such a thing?

About halfway down the hill was a large open air market, where most of the older folks in Goyletown did their shopping. You could find just about anything you needed there, including food that was hot and ready to eat. Leviathan didn’t mind shopping at supermarkets, but there _was_ something special about the old school street shops.

The smell of a dozen cuisines wafted through the air, making his mouth water. _I could really go for a she-bat stew right about now_, he thought. He looked longingly towards the colorful tents and watched the steam from many kitchens rising into the air, but shook it off and kept going down the hill.

_Gotta stick to the plan_.

Up ahead, near the entrance of the Mole District would be the buzzing neon sign of the Milky Maiden. Most law-abiding citizens would never darken the doors of the dingy dungeon of an establishment, but ol’ Bessy Bell knew how to make a _mean_ mug of chocolate milk. He’d spent many nights slurping down huge mugs of the sweet cold concoction. Most of those nights ended with him stumbling up the hill towards Goyletown with a stomach ache and a looming headache that would bother him all the next day.

_Totally worth it._

He reached the bottom of the hill and turned right onto Dark Valley Alley, passing through the wrought-iron archway that was the entrance to the Mole District. As the name might suggest, this part of town was darker than most of the city. Originally, it was home to the giant moles that discovered the underground cavern and suggested it as a safe haven from the war. When Buggsy took over the mob, more than a decade ago, he _acquired_ it and ran the moles off. Most of them lived in basements across the city now.

The sketchy shops that lined the Dark Valley Alley were all guarded by heavy bars on the windows and doors. Brave souls ran street cart businesses, but were often robbed by street urchins. Leviathan’s friend Joe had a killer sandwich cart that made no real profit, but Joe didn’t seem to mind. He was just happy to be slinging good food and making enough to take care of his family. Leviathan was a little jealous, in some ways. It would be nice to _have_ a family to care for, but he was all alone.

The thought of Joe’s cart made his stomach grumble again. He considered heading to the other end of the alley and grabbing a quick bite, but he really didn’t have time to waste. The type who would let valuable information slip wouldn’t be at Betsy’s for much longer. He’d have to eat later.

Leviathan started towards the other side of the street, three doors down, to the neon sign of a spotted cow with the words “Milky Maiden” scribbled out next to it. The front door swung open, flooding the street in front of the bar with warm light. The noise of a dozen happy patrons filled his ears. He could practically taste the chocolate milk already. He reached for the handle as the door swung closed.

_Wham_!

Something hit him hard on the back of the head and everything went black.
